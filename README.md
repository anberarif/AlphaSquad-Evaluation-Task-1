# AlphaSquad-Evaluation-Task-1

## npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if we make edits.
We will also see any lint errors in the console.

## npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.


## npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


## npm run eject
This is a one-way operation. Once we eject, we can’t go back.

If we aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, we can eject at any time.
