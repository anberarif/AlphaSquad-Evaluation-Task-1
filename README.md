# AlphaSquad-Evaluation-Task-1

## To create a new app, we may choose one of the following methods:

npx
npx create-react-app my-app
(npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see instructions for older npm versions)

npm
npm init react-app my-app

## Yarn
yarn create react-app my-app


It will create a directory called my-app inside the current folder.
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure.



Once the installation is done, we can open your project folder:

cd my-app
Inside the newly created project, we can run some built-in commands:

## npm start or yarn start

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if we make changes to the code.

## npm test or yarn test
Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.

## npm run build or yarn build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
